# Riyadh Subways – Software Engineering Project

This is a university project developed during the Software Engineering course at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University.

The project simulates a simplified subway system for the city of Riyadh using object-oriented programming in Java. It allows users to create subway lines, add stations, and manage routes in a modular, class-based structure.

---

##  Objective

- Apply software engineering and OOP principles in a real-world inspired system.
- Design classes representing subway components (lines, stations, paths).
- Implement basic logic to handle the creation and interaction of these components.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Javascript
- Black box and white box (testing)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

##  Project Structure

- `Main.java` – Runs the program and initializes the subway system
- `Line.java` – Class representing a subway line
- `Station.java` – Class representing a station
- `SubwaySystem.java` – Core system logic

---

##  Features

- Create subway lines and stations
- Assign stations to lines
- Display current subway structure
- Easy to extend or integrate with GUI in the future

---

## Future Improvements

- Add graphical user interface (GUI)
- Add station search and route-finding logic
- Implement data saving/loading from files
